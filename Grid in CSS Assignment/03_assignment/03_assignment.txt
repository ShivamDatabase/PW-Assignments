In CSS Grid Layout, the 'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns' properties are used to define the size of implicitly created rows and columns in a grid, respectively. 
These properties apply to rows and columns that are not explicitly defined using the 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns' properties.
Here's a brief explanation and an example code snippet for both properties:

1. 'grid-auto-rows':

This property sets the size of implicitly created rows in the grid. 
It specifies the size of rows that are created when the number of rows specified in 'grid-template-rows' is less than the number of items placed in the grid.

Example CSS:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
  grid-auto-rows: 50px; /* Sets the height of implicitly created rows */
}

.grid-item {
  border: 1px solid black;
}


*In this example, the explicit rows are set to be 50px in height, but any additional rows created beyond the specified two rows will have a height of 50px due to `grid-auto-rows`.

Example HTML :

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
</div>


2. 'grid-auto-columns':

This property sets the size of implicitly created columns in the grid. 
It specifies the size of columns that are created when the number of columns specified in 'grid-template-columns' is less than the number of items placed in the grid.

Example CSS:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
  grid-auto-columns: 100px; /* Sets the width of implicitly created columns */
}

.grid-item {
  border: 1px solid black;
}


*In this example, the explicit columns are set to be 100px in width, but any additional columns created beyond the specified two columns will have a width of 100px due to `grid-auto-columns`.

Example HTML:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
</div>


*These properties are useful when you want to define a grid structure, but the number of items placed in the grid exceeds the explicitly defined rows or columns. 
The 'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns' properties help you control the size of the implicitly created rows and columns.
