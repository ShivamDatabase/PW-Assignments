1.Absolute Positioning:
Syntax- 
    .absolute-positioned {
        position: absolute;
    }

* When an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal document flow. 
It is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor that has a position other than static), 
or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found.
* Absolute positioning allows you to precisely place an element anywhere on the page, regardless of its normal position in the document flow.
* Other elements in the document flow will ignore the space occupied by absolutely positioned elements.
* If no positioned ancestor is found, absolute positioning is relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the viewport.


2.Relative Positioning:
Syntax- 
        .relative-positioned {
            position: relative;
        }

* When an element is positioned relatively, it remains in the normal document flow, but its position can be adjusted relative to its normal position.
* Other elements in the document flow are not affected by the relative positioning of an element.
* The space the element would have occupied in the normal flow is still reserved.
* If you move a relatively positioned element, it will affect the position of other elements on the page.
